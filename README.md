# T-GEN

T-GEN (Transcriptome-mediated identification of disease-associated Genes with Epigenetic aNnotation) is a framework to identify disease-associated genes leveraging epigenetic information. The preprint can be found at [Leveraging funcational annotation to identify genes associated with complex diseases](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/529297v4).

## Prerequisites
The software is developed and tested in Linux and Mac OS environments. 


## Acknowledgement
Part of the gene expression imputation code is modified from [varbvs](https://github.com/pcarbo/varbvs). Part of the test code is modified from [MetaXcan] (https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan). We thank the authors for sharing the code.
